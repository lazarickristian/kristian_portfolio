# 🧑‍💻 Personal Portfolio & CV Website

Welcome to my **personal portfolio and CV website**, built using the **Django Framework** as a way to showcase my growing skills in **Python programming**. As a beginner in software development, I created this platform to demonstrate my capabilities in **web development**, **data science**, and **web scraping**.

## 🌟 What You'll Find

This site includes several **interactive applications** that reflect my hands-on experience with Python. These apps are available **only to registered users** and serve as practical demonstrations of my coding abilities.

Each registered user gets their own private space where they can:

- 📝 Update their profile  
- ✏️ Edit details  
- ❌ Delete their account  

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap template from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com) (with custom modifications)
- **Icons:** [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) icons

While I’m still learning **HTML** and **CSS**, I’ve done my best to improve the design and user experience. I welcome any feedback or suggestions you might have!

## 📬 Get in Touch

Have questions, advice, or collaboration ideas? I’d love to hear from you!

➡️ Use the **Contact Form** on the website to reach out.  
➡️ Or connect with me via email or social media (details on the site).

## 🧠 Open to Feedback

This project is open-source and available on my **GitHub profile**. If you’re curious about the code, want to offer advice, or just want to see how I’ve built things, feel free to explore the repository and leave comments or suggestions.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

This site is not just a portfolio—it's a growing space for learning, sharing, and connecting with others in the tech community. Whether you're a fellow beginner, an experienced developer, or a potential employer, thanks for visiting!
